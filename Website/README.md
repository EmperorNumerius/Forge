# Forge editor

This is the forge editor site. Forge is a work in progress 3D printer YSWS(You Ship We Ship) project being worked on by teens at [hackclub](https://hackclub.com). You can find the official forge repository [here](https://github.com/EmperorNumerius/Forge), and if you wish to contribute, you should join the hackclub slack and visit the channel #forge-dev.

The editor was mostly inspired by [the online openscad playground](https://ochafik.com/openscad2/) and other Hack Club YSWS projects.
